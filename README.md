Replicate the Photoshop wireframe design as accurately as possible using HTML/CSS. 

You've been supplied a 'desktop' (2000px wide) .PSD design mockup, and a 'mobile' (420px wide) .PSD design mockup. It is your choice whether you'd like to code desktop-down, or mobile-up. Both mockups are provided so you can see the desired end-goal on each end of the spectrum.

*If coding desktop-down, the design only needs to be be responsive down to 1000px. The design does not need to be responsive below 1000px.

*If coding mobile-up, the design only needs to be respondive up to 1000px. The design does not need to be resonsibe above 1000px.

**If you're feeling motivated make the entire design responsive from 420-2000px,  go for it!

The Google font used is Open Sans (Semi-bold & Extra-bold). Font files are supplied in the zip folder. You aren't required to add in extra "pizzaz", but you have complete freedom to do so... Hover states, scroll animations etc. The most important thing is attention to details and clean code.

Upon completion:

Please send a packaged zip file of all your project files when complete (.html, css, image folders etc.)
